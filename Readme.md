## :scroll: Event Snippet

In this training series, we will be learning Git. It is a free and open-source **distributed version control system** designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. 
We will be also exploring **Github** which is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others collaborate together on the same projects from anywhere so that we can collaborate with others from a remote repository. 
Apart from these learnings, we will also be hearing from **Mr. Jakaria Rabbi** who is currently a _Github Campus Advisor_ at Khulna University of Engineering and Technology (KUET). He will be sharing us various ideas regarding **Github Campus Advisor** and **Github Campus Expert** Program.

**This Training Series is covering following topics :**
- Command Line and Git Environment
- Git Basic Commands
- Git Branching
- Working on Remote Repository
- Exclusive talk on "Github Campus Expert"
- Insights on "Github Campus Advisor"
